            Welcome to <strong><?= CONFIG['name'] ?></strong>. In a digital world filled with long, complex, and often untrustworthy links, our mission is simple: to provide a fast, secure, and privacy-focused tool that puts you in control. We believe that sharing a link should be easy, transparent, and safe.

        <h3>Core Philosophy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> We don't require accounts. We don't use tracking cookies. We process the absolute minimum data required to make a link work, and we are transparent about it in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Our entire codebase is open source under the AGPL-v3 license. This means you can inspect our code, verify our security practices, and even run your own instance. We believe in the power of community and transparency. Check out our project on <a href="/github" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Security by Design:</strong> Every link is checked against global security blocklists, and our platform is protected by Cloudflare to prevent spam and abuse. We take the safety of our users seriously.</li>
        </ul>
