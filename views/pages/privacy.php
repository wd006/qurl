    <p><?= CONFIG['name'] ?> ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our URL shortening service (the "Service").</p>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h4>1. Our Philosophy: Data Minimization</h4>
        <p>Our core principle is to collect the absolute minimum information necessary to provide a functional and secure service. We do not require user accounts, and we do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) like your name, email address, or physical address.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h4>2. Information You Provide</h4>
        <p>When you create a short link, you voluntarily provide the following information, which is necessary for the link to function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The original long URL you wish to shorten.</li>
            <li>Any optional settings you configure, such as a custom alias, password protection, or a preview note.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is stored publicly and is directly tied to the functionality of the short link you create.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h4>3. Information We Process Automatically</h4>
        <p>To ensure the security and integrity of our Service, we automatically process certain technical information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server Logs:</strong> Like most web servers, our system logs basic, non-identifying information for each request. This may include your IP address, browser type, and the date/time of your visit. This data is used exclusively for security monitoring, abuse prevention, and technical troubleshooting. These logs are routinely purged and are not used to track you.</li>
            <li><strong>CAPTCHA Verification:</strong> To prevent automated abuse (spam), we use Cloudflare Turnstile to verify that requests are made by a human. This is a privacy-preserving security service. While it may set a strictly necessary cookie to function, it does not track you across sites.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h4>4. Cookies</h4>
        <p>Our core service does not use cookies for tracking, advertising, or analytics. The only potential cookie usage comes from the strictly necessary security components, such as the CAPTCHA service mentioned above, which is essential for protecting the platform from bots.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h4>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
        <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or trade your information.</strong> The data you provide (the long URL) is only "shared" in the sense that anyone with the short link will be redirected to it. We will not disclose server log information to third parties unless required by law.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h4>6. Changes to This Policy</h4>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
